# Scumm Bar Twitter

This app is inspired by a task I had to deliver for a technical interview.
It's developed for learning purposes and simulates a Twitter like app.

[Live demo](https://scumm-bar-twitter.vercel.app)

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

- [React](https://es.reactjs.org)
- [styled components](https://styled-components.com)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (Deployment and Serverless Functions)
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io)

<h2>Setup</h2>

- Install dependencies:

```shell
yarn install
```

- Running the app in local:

```shell
yarn start
```

- Running tests:

```shell
yarn test
```

- Running e2e tests:

```shell
yarn test:e2e
```

<h2>Todo </h2>

- [ ] Refactor sass to styled components
- [ ] Extract api to another service
- [ ] More tests (some tests fail due to refactoring the app from vanillaJS)
